We read both Rr+1 and Rr, concatenate them, and send them through MUXG and the
address adder (using "move", keeping it unchanged) so that we can get the upper
byte into inA and the lower byte into inB (through MUXC).  Both values are then
written to Rd+1 and Rd, respectively.

2.

a.

EX1:    DMAR <- AR-1, AR <- AR-1
EX2:    Rd <- M[DMAR]

In the first execute cycle, the given Address Register (AR) is decremented and
then stored both in DMAR and back in the register file.  In the second execute
cycle, the address in DMAR is used to read a byte from data memory, which is
then stored in Rd.

In the first execute cycle, we read both bytes of the given Address Register
(AR), concatenate them, and pass them through MUXG to be incremented in the
address adder.  The incremented address is then passed through MUXH into DMAR
to access data memory in the next execute cycle, and also stored back in the
register file, the lower byte passing through MUXC.  In the second execute
cycle, the address in DMAR is used to read a byte from data memory, which is
then passed through MUXB and MUXC to inB of the register file so it can be
stored at Rd.  This instruction takes two cycles because we need to access 3
different registers from the register file, but can only access 2 per cycle.

3.

a.

EX1:    M[SP] <- RARl, SP <- SP-1
EX2:    M[SP] <- RARh, SP <- SP-1, PC <- Z

Since RAR <- PC+1 already happened in the fetch cycle, we can go straight to
copying the high and low bytes of the RAR (Return Address Register) into the
stack, decrementing the stack pointer after each byte is added.  We then copy
the contents of the Z register to PC to jump to the next instruction.

In the first execute cycle, we use MUXI to read the low byte of RAR and use the
stack pointer to store it on the stack in data memory, decrementing the stack
pointer afterwards.  We do the same with the high byte of RAR in the next
execute cycle.  Then we read both bytes of Z from the register file,
concatenate them, pass the result through MUXG and the address adder (without
changing it), and then sending it to PC through MUXJ.

a.

EX1:    SP <- SP+1
EX2:    SP <- SP+1, PCh <- M[SP]
EX3:    PCl <- M[SP]

Since CALL decrements the stack pointer after storing the return address (RA),
we increment it before using it both times.  We then read each byte at the
addresses in data memory pointed to by the stack pointer and store them in PC
so that we jump back to the return address on the next fetch cycle.

In the first execute cycle, we increment the stack pointer, and that's all we
can do since it needs another cycle before it will latch and become usable.  In
the second execute cycle, we increment it again (for use in execute cycle 3)
and use the current stack pointer to read the high byte of the return address
(RA) from the stack in data memory and send it to PCh through DEMUX.  In the
third execute cycle, we read the low byte of the RA and send it to PCl.
