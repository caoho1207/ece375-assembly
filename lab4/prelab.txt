ECE 375 Lab 4 Prelab

1. For this lab, you will be asked to perform arithmetic operations on numbers
that are larger than 8-bits. To do this, you should understand the different
arithmetic operations supported by the AVR Architecture. List and describe all
the different forms of ADD, SUB, and MUL (i.e. ADC, SUBI, MULF, etc.).

ADC: Add with carry - Two registers and the carry bit are added and the result is placed in the first register.
ADD: Add without carry - Two registers are added and the result is placed in the first register, with the carry bit ignored.
ADIW: Adds a register pair (of the upper four register pair) to an immediate value (from 0-63).
SBC: Subtract with carry - Two registers and the carry bit are subtracted and the result is placed in the first register.
SUB: Subtract with carry - Two registers are subtracted and the result is placed in the first register, with the carry bit ignored.


2. Write pseudo-code that describes a function that will take two 16-bit
numbers in data memory addresses $0110-$0111 and $0121- $0122 and add them
together. The function will then store the resulting 16-bit number at the
address $0100-$0101. (Hint: The upper address corresponds to the high byte of
the number and donâ€™t forget about the carry in bit.)
