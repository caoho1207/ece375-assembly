ECE 375 Lab 6 Prelab

1. I have an old remote-controlled Lego Spybotics vehicle that is quite similar
to a Tekbot in functionality; the remote control allows both forward and
backward control of both the left and right motors.  Additionally, it even had
a whisker in the front (only one though instead of two) that would cause it to
reverse and turn around when running an autonomous program.

For the forward and backward movement of the left and right motors, all that is
needed is the code from the previous lab in the HitRight and HitLeft routines.

For the actual remote control aspect, the USART can be set up to receive
commands and trigger an interrupt that will perform those commands (as opposed
to the robot constantly polling for commands).

For the whisker-triggered turning functionality, an interrupt can be set to go
off when the whisker is hit and perform the turnaround, just like in the
BumpBot program from the last lab.  In order to make sure that the turnaround
functionality overrides manual user control, it can be set as a lower
interrupt, giving it higher priority.  If need be, interrupts can also be
manually enabled during manual user control interrupt routines so that the
interrupts can be interrupted.
