\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this lab is to allow us to become familiar with an embedded
system other than the AVR boards, namely, the Intel Atom AIMB 213 Embedded
Developer Board.  We also learn how to communicate with external devices using
SMBus and how to create Qt GUI projects.

\section{Conclusion}

In this lab, I started to become familiar with Qt and also got a little bit more C++ experience (I didn't have much before).  I also learned a bit about how to interface with low-level devices from higher-level programs in a more desktop-like embedded environment.
