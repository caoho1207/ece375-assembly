My answer:
TEMP <- MAR     (store pointer address in temp)
MDR <- M(MAR)   (load pointer from memory to mdr)
MAR <- MDR      (load pointer from mdr to mar)
MDR <- AC       (move data to mdr)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write data to memory)
MAR <- TEMP     (move pointer address to mar)
MDR <- M(MAR)   (load pointer from memory to mdr)
AC <- MDR       (move pointer to ac)
AC <- AC + 1    (increment pointer)
MDR <- AC       (move pointer to mdr)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write pointer to memory)

Optimized version of the above:
TEMP <- MAR, MDR <- M(MAR)
MAR <- MDR
MDR <- AC
M(MAR) <- MDR
MAR <- TEMP
MDR <- M(MAR)
AC <- MDR
AC <- AC + 1
MDR <- AC
M(MAR) <- MDR

Different answer:
MDR <- M(MAR)   (load old pointer from memory to mdr)
TEMP <- AC      (store data in temp)
AC <- MDR       (store old pointer in ac)
MDR <- TEMP     (store data in mdr)
TEMP <- MAR     (store pointer address in temp)
MAR <- AC       (store old pointer in mar)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write data to memory)
AC <- AC + 1    (increment pointer)
MAR <- TEMP     (store pointer address in mar)
MDR <- AC       (store new pointer in mdr)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write new pointer to memory)

Optimized version of the above:
MDR <- M(MAR)   (load old pointer from memory to mdr), TEMP <- AC       (store data in temp)
AC <- MDR       (store old pointer in ac)
MDR <- TEMP     (store data in mdr)
TEMP <- MAR     (store pointer address in temp)
MAR <- AC       (store old pointer in mar)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write data to memory), AC <- AC + 1    (increment pointer)
MAR <- TEMP     (store pointer address in mar)
MDR <- AC       (store new pointer in mdr)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write new pointer to memory)

Optimized version of the above:
MDR <- M(MAR)   (load old pointer from memory to mdr)
TEMP <- MAR     (store pointer address in temp)
MAR <- MDR      (store old pointer in mar)
MDR <- AC       (store data in mdr)
AC <- MAR       (store old pointer in ac), M(MAR) <- MDR    (write data to memory)
AC <- AC + 1    (increment pointer), MAR <- TEMP        (store pointer address in mar)
MDR <- AC       (store new pointer in mdr)
M(MAR) <- MDR   (write new pointer to memory)
